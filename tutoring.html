<h5>Knowledgeable and Engaging</h5>
<p>
Osaze by far is probably one of the best tutors, hands down! My daughter has been having a lot of trouble with her engineering courses, but thanks to Osaze's help he really takes the time to understand and improve my daughter's grades. My daughter really enjoys every lesson with Osaze as he is very patient and does the best to his ability to make sure you are good to go before every lesson. We are very happy having Osaze as a tutor and are so glad to have made this connection. Thanks a bunch!

<h5>The BEST Object Oriented Programming Tutor</h5>
<p>
    I came to Osaze with a huge project and he was so patient and diligent in understanding my problem and the assignment that need to be done. I was having issues with understanding how to begin a method in Java programming assignment and Osaze helped me solve the problem and understand each step we were taking to get to the solution. Osaze is very knowledgable in Java and will be definitely be rescheduling with him!

<h5>Osaze is patient, experienced and most of all a very worthwhile tutor.</h5>
<p>
    Osaze helped me learn key concepts about Collections in Java. He was patient and thorough in providing his experience to assist my understanding of key concepts of my current Java module. I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking to learn more about computer science or who is looking for someone to point out errors in code.

<h5>Very patient and understanding</h5>
<p>
    He gave extra tools to help me in my future process and broadened my view on Verilog, especially the coding area of my example midterm. He allowed a little extra time without charging me and I will definitely be using his service in the future.

<h5>Excellent tutor</h5>
<p>
    Osaze is amazing! He took an incredibly convoluted and not so clear project and spun it into a clear and easy to understand lesson. VERY HIGHLY recommend! Worked on swift and Xcode.
